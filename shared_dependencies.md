The shared dependencies between the files "main.py" and "bardapi/core.py" are:

1. Imported Libraries: Both files share the dependency on the 'bardapi' library. This library is imported in "main.py" and it's likely used in "bardapi/core.py" as it's part of the same package.

2. Variables: The 'token' variable is defined in "main.py" and used in "bardapi/core.py". This variable stores the \__Secure-1PSID cookie value.

3. Function Names: The function 'type_response' is defined in "main.py" and it might be used in "bardapi/core.py". Another function 'chatbot' is also defined in "main.py" which uses the 'Bard' class from 'bardapi.core' and its method 'get_answer'.

4. Class Names: The 'Bard' class from 'bardapi.core' is used in "main.py". This class and its methods are likely defined in "bardapi/core.py".

5. Data Schemas: The 'response' data schema is used in "main.py" and likely defined in "bardapi/core.py". It's used to store the response from the 'get_answer' method of the 'Bard' class.

Note: As the code for "bardapi/core.py" is not provided, the dependencies for this file are assumed based on the usage in "main.py".
